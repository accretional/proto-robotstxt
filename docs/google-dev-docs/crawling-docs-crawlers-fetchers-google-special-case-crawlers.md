# List of Google's special-case crawlers
 
 The special-case crawlers are used by specific Google products where there's an agreement between the crawled site and the product about the crawl process. For example, AdsBot ignores the global robots.txt user agent (*) with the ad publisher's permission. The general technical properties of Google's crawlers also apply to the special-case crawlers. 
 
 The special-case crawlers may ignore robots.txt rules and so they operate from a different IP range than the common crawlers. The IP ranges are published in the special-crawlers.json object. The special-case crawlers' reverse DNS mask matches rate-limited-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com. 
 
 The following list shows the special-case crawlers, their user agent strings as they appear in the HTTP requests, their user agent tokens for the User-agent: line in robots.txt, and the products that are affected by crawl preferences for the crawler. The list is not exhaustive, it only covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that we've received questions about.
