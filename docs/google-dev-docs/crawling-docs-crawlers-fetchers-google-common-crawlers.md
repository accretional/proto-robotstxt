# List of Google's common crawlers

Google's common crawlers are used to find information for building Google's search indexes, perform other product specific crawls, and for analysis. They always obey robots.txt rules when crawling automatically. The general technical properties of Google's crawlers also apply to the common crawlers.

The common crawlers generally crawl from the IP ranges published in the common-crawlers.json object, and the reverse DNS mask of their hostname matches crawl-***-***-***-***.googlebot.com or geo-crawl-***-***-***-***.geo.googlebot.com.

The following list shows the common crawlers, their user agent strings as they appear in the HTTP requests, their user agent tokens for the User-agent: line in robots.txt, and the products that are affected by crawl preferences for the crawler. Some crawlers have more than one user agent token; you need to match only one crawler token for a rule to apply. The list is not exhaustive, it only covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that we've received questions about.

Google-Extended does not impact a site's inclusion in Google Search nor is it used as a ranking signal in Google Search.

## A note about Chrome/W.X.Y.Z in user agents

The string Chrome/W.X.Y.Z in the user agent strings in the list is a placeholder that represents the version of the Chrome browser used by that user agent: for example, 41.0.2272.96. This version number increases over time to match the latest Chromium release version used by Googlebot.

If you are searching your logs or filtering your server for a user agent with this pattern, use wildcards for the version number rather than specifying an exact version number.
