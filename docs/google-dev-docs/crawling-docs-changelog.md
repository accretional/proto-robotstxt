## May 2026

May 4

### Adding Web Bot Auth documentation

What: Added documentation on how to authenticate requests with Web Bot Auth.

Why: To provide site owners with instructions on how to verify requests with Web Bot Auth during the experimental phase, as some Google user agents are now starting to use Web Bot Auth.

## March 2026

March 20

### Added the Google-Agent user agent

What: Added the Google-Agent user agent and added the IP ranges for user triggered agents to the documentation on verifying requests from Google crawlers and fetchers.

Why: The Google-Agent user agent is rolling out over the next few weeks, and will be used by Google agents hosted on Google infrastructure to navigate the web and perform actions upon user request.

March 3

### Added an overview page about Google's web crawling

What: Added a new page about how Google's crawling works.

Why: Based on questions we've received over the years, we've put together a resource page with basic educational information about crawling to better highlight various resources about crawling that are available to site owners.

## February 2026

February 11

### Updated the location of Google's IP ranges for common crawlers, special crawlers, and user-triggered fetchers

What: Updated the location of Google's IP ranges for common crawlers, special crawlers, and user-triggered fetchers to the /crawling/ipranges directory. The old location will continue to work for the time being, but we recommend updating your links to the new location.

Why: Their previous location in /search/apis/ipranges was not the most logical place, as these IP ranges are used by many Google products (not just Search).

February 3

### Added information about the default file size limits for Google's crawlers and fetchers

What: Moved the information about the default file size limits of Google's crawlers and fetchers from the Googlebot documentation to the crawling documentation.

Why: The original location of this information was not the most logical place as it applies to all of Google's crawlers and fetchers, and so we moved it to the crawler infrastructure documentation.

## January 2026

January 21

### Added Google Messages to the list of user-triggered fetchers

What: Added the Google Messages fetcher to the list of user-triggered fetchers.

Why: To help site owners identify traffic from Google Messages when it generates link previews for URLs sent in chat messages.

## December 2025

December 18

### Migrated more documentation to the Google crawling documentation site

What: Migrated the following documentation to Google's crawling infrastructure site. The functionality hasn't changed, only the location of the documentation and some minor wording changes to clarify that some guidance applies to both Google Search and other Google products.

- Managing crawling of faceted navigation URLs

- Optimize your crawl budget

- How HTTP status codes affect Google's crawlers

- Debug DNS and network errors

Why: This documentation is more relevant to many Google products that use Google's crawlers, not just Search.

December 2

### Updated Google Read Aloud user agent page

What: Updated the Google Read Aloud user agent page to provide additional details on how it functions, in particular that it uses stateless rendering, and that it needs to access the page to see the meta tags used on the page.

Why: We received feedback through the help community that more information would be helpful.

## November 2025

November 20

### Migrated documentation to the new Google crawling documentation site

What: Migrated crawling documentation from the Google Search Central to a new Google crawling documentation site. The content hasn't changed, only the location. Notable moves include:

- Overview of Google crawlers and fetchers

- Verify requests from Google crawlers and fetchers

- Reduce the Google crawl rate

- Google common crawlers

- How Google interprets the robots.txt specification

Why: Google's crawling infrastructure is shared across a variety of Google products beyond Search, including Google Shopping, News, Gemini, AdSense, and more. The new site is a more logical home for this documentation and makes it easier to document new features and updates that are relevant to all of these products.

November 12

### Added the Google-Pinpoint fetcher

What: We added the Google-Pinpoint fetcher to the list of user-triggered fetchers.

Why: The Google-Pinpoint fetcher is used by the Pinpoint research tool.

November 3

### Added a new user-triggered fetcher

What: Based on feedback, we added the Google-CWS fetcher to the list of user-triggered fetchers.

## October 2025

October 15

### Updated the list of Google products that use the Read Aloud service

What: Update the documentation on Google Read Aloud with an updated list of Google products that use the Read Aloud service.

Why: Other Google products can now use the Google Read Aloud service.

October 9

### Added Google-NotebookLM to the list of user-triggered fetchers

What: Based on feedback, we added Google-NotebookLM to the list of user-triggered fetchers.

## July 2025

July 1

### Updated the Google Read Aloud user agent

What: Updated Google Read Aloud user agent in HTTP requests with newer browser versions.

Why: To accommodate sites which don't support old browser versions.

## April 2025

April 25

### Updated the description of the Google-Extended product token

What: Based on publisher feedback, we updated the Google-Extended product token description to provide additional specificity and clarity.

### Corrected the description of the crawler preferences addressed to the Googlebot-News user agent

What: Updated the Googlebot-News user agent description.

Why: The description for how crawling preferences addressed to Googlebot-News mistakenly stated that they'd affect the News tab on Google, which is not the case.
